# Telecom_Case-Study
Problem Statement
In this project,to minimize customer churn, telecom company needs to predict which customers are at high risk of churn.So, we have to analyse customer-level data of a leading telecom firm, build predictive models to identify customers at high risk of churn and identify the main indicators of churn.

Therefore, telecom company could take proactive initiatives to retaining high profitable customers.

Churn is predicted using two approaches. 
- Usage based churn
- Revenue based churn

In the Indian and the southeast Asian market, approximately 80% of revenue comes from the top 20% customers (called high-value customers). Thus, if we can reduce churn of the high-value customers, we will be able to reduce significant revenue leakage. Hence, this case study focuses on high value customers only.

The dataset contains customer-level information for a span of four consecutive months - June, July, August and September. The months are encoded as 6, 7, 8 and 9, respectively

This is a classification problem, where we need to predict whether the customers is about to churn or not. We have carried out Baseline Logistic Regression, then Logistic Regression with PCA, PCA + Random Forest, PCA + XGBoost.
